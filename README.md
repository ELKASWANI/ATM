An ATM machine simulator. Create an Account class with all the attributes
that characterize a bank account, and all the methods needed, including
toString() and equals(). You have provide operations such as deposit,
withdraw, transfer between accounts and print balance. Assume the ATM
only manages 3 accounts. Challenge: the account could be configured to
always withdraw money with the least amount of bills possible. For
instance, if 90 CAD is requested, the least amount would be 1 bill of 50 CAD
and 2 bills of 20 CAD.
